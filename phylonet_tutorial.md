# Phylonet tutorial

## Installation
Donwload binary jar file from [here](https://bioinfocs.rice.edu/phylonet)

Also need to install Beagle, I followed this [link](https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib/wiki/LinuxInstallInstructions)

Everytime before I run Phylonet, I have to run on the terminal this:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

##
```bash
java -jar $PHYLONET_DIRECTORY/PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar script.nex

#### Get Tracer readable files
Convert the log file generated by our MCMC sampling method to be readable by Tracer

```bash
SummarizeMCMCResults -mode "Tracer" [-cl chainLength] [-bl burnInLength] [-sf sampleFrequency] [-outfile filename] [-truenet networkString] 
```
